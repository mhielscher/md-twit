md-twit
======

"md" stands for Minimal Desktop.

md-twit is a Python script that uses gtk and pywebkit to create a small wrapper around the mobile Twitter website. The point is to let you fit Twitter in a small space on your screen, without depending on third-party clients.

As minimal as it is currently, there are no preferences. It will always appear in the upper-right corner of the monitor the cursor is in. You must log in every time it starts. Preferences for appearance and automatic login via cookies are planned features.
